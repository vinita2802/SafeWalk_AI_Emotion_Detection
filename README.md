# 🔐 SAFEWALK AI – 🛡️ Real-Time Danger Detection & Emotion-Based Safety Companion

SafeWalk AI is a powerful AI solution designed to **detect danger or distress from voice emotions** in real time.  
It uses **audio emotion recognition** to identify fear, anger, or panic from voice samples—offering smart alerts for safety.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open the notebook:  
   `SafeWalk_AI_Emotion_Detection.ipynb`
3. Add your audio file inside the folder:  
   `sample_audio/`
4. Run all cells in the notebook.
5. The model will predict the **emotion** in the audio clip and indicate if **danger** is detected.
